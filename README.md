# This project is a .NET web service written in C#. The web service takes in a claim as an XML file and inputs all of 
# the data from the XML file into a MySQL database. The web service also allows you to read from the database and find 
# a list of claims by date range or LossDate. 
#
# Unfortunately, due to school work, church duties, and HP work, I was unable to complete these tasks in the time given. 
# I thought that I would be able to complete this on time but learning C# and .NET web service programming from scratch
# proved to be much more time consuming than I could imagine. The web service is incomplete but most of my ideas are there.
